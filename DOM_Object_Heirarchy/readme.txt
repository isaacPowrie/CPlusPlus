THE PROJECT

This object heirarchy takes an html file and loads it into memory as a heirarchical structure similar to the DOM. 
This object structure is accessible through the "Document" object which has several selector functions for viewing 
and printing the elements, text nodes, and attributes of the loaded page. The test case included in this folder 
loads in two simple html strings with slightly different syntaxes and tests to make sure that the node objects
are loaded into memory in the expected way.

USE CASES

This structure can be used as the basis for an element by element text browser or a web scraping project. The 
"Display" interfaces are designed to be used for finding elements, while the "Print" elements can be used for printing 
desired results.
